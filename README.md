# E.coli Polarity Recognition using Fully Connected Model

This repository contains the code and notebooks used for training and testing a fully connected (FC) neural network model to recognize polarity in *E.coli* cells. The analysis supports the findings reported in the associated scientific publication.

## Repository Contents

- `train_fc_model.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook for training the FC model on polarity-labeled data.
- `test_fc_model.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook for evaluating the trained model and performing polarity classification on test samples.
